Patch Diver is a free to use online patch editor that currently supports the Yamaha DX100 and similar 4-operator fm synthesizers from the same era (Yamaha TX81z)

- **Browse:** You can browse sounds by most recent, most liked, or by genre or style of patch.
- **Connect:** Using a usb to midi connection, establish a link between your physical synthesizer and computer.
- **Load:** You can load patches from your synthesizer simply by selecting them, if a patch change is detected on your device Patch Diver will automatically pick it up, no need to dig into complex system exlusive midi librarians.
- **Edit:** Click and drag parameters to edit sounds. The UI is inspired by classic Roland synthesizers for those who wished cumbersome FM synths worked as intuitively as vintage analog synths.
- **Save:** You can save patches to your profile and include categorize by genre, style of patch and the artist or track that your patch resembles.

## ðŸ—º Roadmap

Patch Diver is an ongoing project maintained by one developer. The front end of this application has been converted from JavaScript to TypeScript presenting opportunities to refactor and clean up the codebase. Optimizations/refactors will continue to take place, culminating in a more easily maintainable project.

Some expected future milestones include improvements to the sign-up process, 'forgotten password' routes and support for more synthesizer models.
